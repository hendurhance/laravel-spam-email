## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require martian/spammailchecker
```

```php
Martian\SpamMailChecker\SpamMailCheckerServiceProvider::class,
```
- If you are going to be using the facade, you'll need to register it as well. Open `config/app.php` and add the following line to the `aliases` array:

```php
'SpamMailChecker' => Martian\SpamMailChecker\Facades\SpamMailChecker::class,
```

## Publish Configuration File
Publish the configuration file using the following command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Martian\SpamMailChecker\Providers\SpamMailCheckerServiceProvider"
```

## Configuration
The configuration file is located at `config/laravel-spammail-checker.php`. You may configure the package to use any of the supported drivers. The default driver is `local` which uses a local text list of spam email domains.

#### Local Driver Configuration
- In order to use `local`as your driver of choice, you need to set the `default` key in the `config/laravel-spammail-checker.php` configuration file to `local`:

    ```php
        'default' => 'local',
    ```
- Or you can set the `SPAM_MAIL_CHECKER_DEFAULT_DRIVER` environment variable to `local` in your `.env` file.

    ```env
        SPAM_MAIL_CHECKER_DEFAULT_DRIVER=local
    ```
- The local driver uses a local text list of spam email domains. The file is located at `resources/config/emails.txt`. You can include more domains by adding them to the `blacklist` array or exclude domains by adding them to the `whitelist` array.

    ```php
        'drivers' => [
            'local' => [
                ...
                'whitelist' => [
                    // Add domains you want the local driver to ignore here
                    'gmail.com',
                    'yahoo.com',
                ],
                'blacklist' => [
                    // Add domains you want the local driver to validate against here
                    'mailinator.com',
                    'spam.com',
                ],
            ]
        ]
    ```
- Clear the config and cache using the following commands after making changes to the configuration file:

    ```bash
        php artisan optimize:clear
    ```
> **NOTE:** The local driver is case-insensitive. So, you don't need to worry about the case of the email domain.

#### Remote Driver Configuration
- In order to use `remote` as your driver of choice, you need to set the `default` key in the `config/laravel-spammail-checker.php` configuration file to `remote`:

    ```php
        'driver' => 'remote',
    ```
- Or you can set the `SPAM_MAIL_CHECKER_DEFAULT_DRIVER` environment variable to `remote` in your `.env` file.

    ```env
        SPAM_MAIL_CHECKER_DEFAULT_DRIVER=remote
    ```
- The remote driver uses PHP In-built functions `getmxrr()`, `checkdnsrr()`. `fsockopen()` to validate email domain. You can configure the remote driver on whether to check for MX - `getmxrr()`, DNS - `checkdnsrr()`, and SMTP -`fsockopen` or validate email domain. You can also configure the timeout value in seconds.

    ```php
        'drivers' => [
            ...
            'remote' => [
                ...
                'check_dns' => true, // When set to true, it will check for DNS
                'check_smtp' => false, // When set to true, it will check for SMTP
                'check_mx' => false, // When set to true, it will check for MX record
                'timeout' => 60 * 5, // 5 minutes
            ]
        ]
    ```

#### AbstractApi Driver Configuration
- In order to use `abstractapi` as your driver of choice, you need to set the `default` key in the `config/laravel-spammail-checker.php` configuration file to `abstractapi`:

    ```env
        'default' => 'abstractapi',
    ```
- Or you can set the `SPAM_MAIL_CHECKER_DEFAULT_DRIVER` environment variable to `abstractapi` in your `.env` file.

  ```
  ABSTRACTAPI_API_KEY=abstractapi_api_key
  ```
- You can configure the `score` to determine the threshold for a valid email address. The score ranges from 0 to 1. The higher the score, the more likely the email address is valid. You can also accept disposable email addresses by setting `accept_disposable` to `true`.

    ```php
        'drivers' => [
            ...
            'abstractapi' => [
                ...
                'score' => 0.5, // 0.5 is the default score
                'accept_disposable_email' => true // When set to true, it will accept disposable email addresses
            ]
        ]
    ```

                ...
                'accept_disposable' => true, // When set to true, it will accept disposable email addresses
            ]
        ]
    ```

#### Verifalia Driver Configuration
- In order to use `verifalia` as your driver of choice, you need to set the `default` key in the `config/laravel-spammail-checker.php` configuration file to `verifalia`:

    ```

## Usage

In order to use the package, you need to call the `spammail` validation rule in your validation rules. You can also change the rule name to whatever you want in the `config/laravel-spammail-checker.php` configuration file under the `rule` key, likewise the error message under the `error_message` key.

```php
/**
 * Get a validator for an incoming registration request.
 *
 * @param  array  $data
 * @return \Illuminate\Contracts\Validation\Validator
 */
protected function validator(array $data)
{
    return Validator::make($data, [
        'email' => 'required|spammail|max:255',
    ]);
}
```
Or make use of `spammail` in your Requests file like this:
```php
 /**
 * Get the validation rules that apply to the request.
 *
 * @return array
 */
public function rules()
{
    return [
        'email' => 'required|spammail|max:255',
    ];
}
```

#### Adding Custom Error Message
A custom error message can be added to the `spammail` validation rule.

```php
    'email.spammail' => 'This email address is invalid.', // Custom error message
```
Or you can change the error message in the `config/laravel-spammail-checker.php` configuration file under the `error_message` key.

```php
    'error_message' => 'This email address is invalid.', // Custom error message
```

#### Using Classes Directly
You can also use the classes directly without using the `spammail` validation rule. This is useful when you want to use the package in your own custom validation rule or your own custom class.

```php
use Martian\SpamMailChecker\SpamMailChecker;

public function checkEmail($email)
{
    $spamMailChecker = new SpamMailChecker();
    $spamMailChecker->validate($email);
}
```

#### Using Facade

You can also use the `SpamMailChecker` class directly without instantiating it.

```php
use Martian\SpamMailChecker\Facades\SpamMailChecker;

public function checkEmail($email)
{
    SpamMailChecker::validate($email);
}
```

#### Using Each Driver Individually
You can also use each driver individually without using the `spammail` validation rule. This is useful when a certain driver is needed in a particular situation.
##### Using VerifaliaDriver
```php
use Martian\SpamMailChecker\Drivers\VerifaliaDriver;

public function checkEmail($email)
{
    $verifaliaDriver = new VerifaliaDriver();
    $verifaliaDriver->validate($email);
}
```
##### Using SendGridDriver
```php
use Martian\SpamMailChecker\Drivers\SendGridDriver;

public function checkEmail($email)
{
    $sendGridDriver = new SendGridDriver();
    $sendGridDriver->validate($email);
}
```
##### Using AbstractApiDriver
```php
use Martian\SpamMailChecker\Drivers\AbstractApiDriver;

public function checkEmail($email)
{
    $abstractApiDriver = new AbstractApiDriver();
    $abstractApiDriver->validate($email);
}
```
##### Using RemoteDriver
```php
use Martian\SpamMailChecker\Drivers\RemoteDriver;

public function checkEmail($email)
{
    $remoteDriver = new RemoteDriver();
    $remoteDriver->validate($email);
}
```
##### Using LocalDriver
```php
use Martian\SpamMailChecker\Drivers\LocalDriver;

public function checkEmail($email)
{
    $localDriver = new LocalDriver();
    $localDriver->validate($email);
}
```
##### Using QuickEmailVerificationDriver
```php
use Martian\SpamMailChecker\Drivers\QuickEmailVerificationDriver;

public function checkEmail($email)
{
    $quickEmailVerificationDriver = new QuickEmailVerificationDriver();
    $quickEmailVerificationDriver->validate($email);
}
```
